# Blogger Advanced

This is a sample project for use with the tutorials at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com

Please do _not_ take it as a set of best practices. In fact, there are many intentional inefficiencies or points of ugliness setup for "fixing" through [tutorial exercises](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby.html).

I updated the [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/decorators.html) so it's based on the latest veresion of ``Draper`` gem now!


# Sample for using Draper & Decorator Pattern

I wrote one possible usage of Draper for having *Decorator Pattern* in this blogger app and also wrote the tests for it as well! There's a bunch of interesting things that can be done with ``Draper`` gem which makes the code more OO and also let you not pollute the model code with view-related stuff!

-BTW I would recommend implement the Decorator Pattern in your code without
any gem at least once to gain a better idea how it can be done in rails! And
then use this interesting gem for doing it in a more efficient way and with
WAY more interesting functionalities!-
